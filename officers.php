                    Hello, my name is Raj Brayana, a fourth-year Chemical Engineering major at UC Berkeley.  I joined Eggster during my first year in college and quickly found a community that was friendly and welcoming. Outside of Eggster, I am a co-founder for PEACE Tutoring, an organization dedicated to fostering a cooperative campus environment by increasing access to education resources. From my experiences, I have learnt the value of investing in our youth and education - a value I intend to carry well beyond college. After graduation, I intend to work in biotech before applying to medical school.

I joined Eggster my Freshman year at Cal because I liked how it brings together various communities to create the "largest, free, annual egg hunt and learning festival in Northern California" and promotes higher education to the youth of under-resourced communities while providing resources to their families. Fun fact: My foreign language is Middle Egyptian (Hierolgyphs)!

Outside of Eggster, I am an active member for PILLS, the pre-pharmacy club on the UC Berkeley campus and a secret sports/exercise fanatic. I joined Eggster last March as a late addition because I was drawn in by the idea of egg hunts for young children. I wanted to be able to personally help them enjoy egg hunts while also experiencing them for the first time myself. In my spare time, I play badminton and read mystery novels.

                    Hi! My name is Kathy Chong and I am a fourth-year Genetics and Plant Biology major. As Event Chair this year, I have really enjoyed bringing the event to life and working with a team of dedicated individuals that share a common vision with me. When I'm not busying planning for Eggster, I enjoy eating, sleeping, watching TV shows, and playing board games. After graduation, I will be attending pharmacy school and be on my way to become a legal drug dispenser!

I joined Eggster because I think the idea of hosting an egg hunt festival for children with an educational purpose is both unique and meaningful, and I really enjoy working with all the members. I am grateful for the opportunity to study here, and believe that other children should have the same opportunity to pursue higher education as well, regardless of their backgrounds.

I am a 4th year Public Health major who attends Economics classes for personal enjoyment, and I have been with Eggster for slightly over two years now. I initially volunteered with Eggster to help a friend, but I stayed because I found the process of putting the event together to be extremely cathartic. My current plans post-graduation include finding some sort of job experience first, then possibly going to graduate school.

I came to Eggster because I needed something to do beside sitting in my apartment and twiddling my thumbs. I heard great things about it and was not disappointed. In these three years, I have learned so many life lessons and made great friends who make it worth sleeping 2 hours the night before an all-day event. Eggster holds a special place during my time at UC Berkeley and the only regret I have is not joining earlier!

            Hello, my name is David Phan and I am a fourth year majoring in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Society, Culture, and Cognition and minoring in Computer Science. I have always volunteered at Eggster through other campus organizations, but this is my first year officially involved with Eggster. I joined Eggster because I share Eggster's vision of education empowerment among underperforming communities, and I hope to help out more so by actually being a part of the organization itself. Apart from Eggster, I'm an active member of Circle K International and the Dwinelle Hall Breakers. In my free time, I like designing websites (a skill I picked up this year!), break-dancing, and playing piano and violin.
