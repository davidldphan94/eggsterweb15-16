        <p>Eggster is a student organization sponsored by ASUC, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization located in Berkeley. Every year we organize and run the Eggster Egghunt and Learning Festival, the largest free egg hunt and learning festival in Northern California. Not only is it free for all kids, it is also a learning festival filled with educational booths and activities! In addition, we partner with local charities to support youth education.</p>
