            Eggster is an on-campus student group and is composed of three committees: 
                    <span style="color:#267266">Finance</span>, <span style="color:#267266">Event</span>, <span style="color:#267266">Public Community Relations</span>. 
                    Each of these committees  provides an opportunity for members to develop an array of skills in leadership, communication, community networking, event planning, advertising, and fundraising. 
                    Our activities include planning our annual, free, on-campus Eggster Egghunt and Learning Festival, going on volunteer outreaches in the Berkeley area, 
                    and raising money for our <a href="beneficiaries.php"  style="color:#2CAEBF">agencies</a>.
                    <br />

                    <p> We would greatly appreciate your participation at the 2015 Eggster Egghunt and Learning Festival!  Student volunteers will be asked to supervise learning booths or conduct egghunts.  You will be interacting with the kids and showing them how cool college is!  You can also volunteer along with other members in your student group.  The day is divided into 3 shifts: <b>8:00-11:00</b>,  <b>10:30-1:30</b>, and <b>1:00-4:00</b>.  Students may participate in one, two, or all three shifts.

                    <p>Want to take a break from school and use your creativity?  The <b>Event Booth and Prop Building Sessions</b> will be during the weekend. (Check the announcements on the first page for exact dates, time, and location.)  The name says it all.  We build props and booths for the Eggster Egghunt and Learning Festival.  You can come in at any point during this time period and paint banners, make booth activities or event props.  Even if you aren't too creative, we'll be able to find a project for you.  Everyone is welcome to help out; you don't need to be an Eggster member or volunteering at the Eggster Egghunt and Learning Festival.  Email <a href="mailto:eggsterevent@gmail.com">eggsterevent@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions.
